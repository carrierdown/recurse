# re<urse

re<urse is a declarative language for generating musical patterns.

### Why re<urse

You might ask why you need a new language for this purpose.

- Focus on minimal syntax
- Many existing implementations focus heavily on synthesis. Since re<urse is focused purely on sequencing, it can focus on a few simple constructs and should therefore be easy to learn.
- It is designed to augment you're existing workflow rather than adding yet another environment, meaning that it works by scripting an existing host like Ableton Live, Bitwig Studio, or Renoise. In fact, it _only_ works in conjunction with an existing DAW - it produces no audio or midi output on it's own.

### Status

This project is currently in alpha, and I'm planning to release v1.0 sometime during the autumn of 2016.

### Introduction
